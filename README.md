## How to Contribute

1. Clone the repo
2. Follow instructions here to test locally: https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/
i.e. do:

pip install mkdocs
cd <project_directory>
mkdocs serve
```
You can then view documentation locally at: localhost:8000

### Making Changes

Here is a guide on how to make changes to the documentation: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/

Basically, to add a new page, add a new markdown file to the docs folder. Then, point to the new page in the mkdocs.yml file under nav:.

I am using a special theme called material for MkDocs allowing for more UI customization. Here is a reference: https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/


### Viewing and Pushing Changes

Any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the local server. After you commit and push, the changes should be reflected in the live site.

#### ReadtheDocs

I use ReadtheDocs to host the documentation. It automatically updates the documentation on the website whenever you push to the main branch. 

1. Signup for Readthedocs here: https://readthedocs.org/accounts/signup/ 
2. Then let me know your username so I can add you as a maintainer.
