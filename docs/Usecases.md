## Use Cases and Addressing Biases with UnBIAS

### 1. News Article Analysis

**Scenario:** News agencies experience shifts in global perspectives, necessitating adjustments in how biases are detected in new articles.

**Steps:** 
- Continually gather labeled data from newer articles.
- Periodically re-train the UnBIAS model with the updated dataset to reflect evolving biases and narratives.
- Integrate the latest model to monitor and rectify biases in published content.

### 2. Business Communications

**Scenario:** A multinational corporation expands to new regions, encountering diverse cultural and linguistic nuances.

**Steps:** 
- Source region-specific data that highlights potential biases unique to the new location.
- Augment the training dataset with this data and re-train the UnBIAS model.
- Incorporate the updated model in the communication approval process to ensure local sensitivities are respected.

### 3. Social Media Monitoring

**Scenario:** A brand launches a new product, leading to different kinds of discussions and potentially new biases on social media.

**Steps:** 
- Extract and label relevant discussions about the new product.
- Update the UnBIAS model by training it with the augmented dataset.
- Use the refined model for real-time analysis of brand mentions and address biases appropriately.

### 4. Financial Analysis

**Scenario:** A financial institution uses UnBIAS to monitor biases in investor communications. Over time, market dynamics change, leading to new terminologies and potential biases.

**Steps:** 
- Gather investor communications, especially those around new market phenomena or products.
- Label the dataset to identify new forms of biases tied to the evolving financial landscape.
- Re-train the UnBIAS model with this data to keep the bias detection updated.
- Integrate the model into the institution's communication analysis pipeline to ensure accurate bias detection.

!!! note "Note:"
    Re-training models is essential when dealing with evolving domains. As language and societal perspectives change, models like UnBIAS should be updated to maintain their accuracy and relevance. Periodic re-training ensures that the tool remains effective in various scenarios, including specialized domains like finance.
    See the [Data Preparation](data_prep) section for re-training the pipeline.
